## Running the Application 
i used python version 3.13 so i had to change the required versions of some libs as they only work with python 3.11
### create venv
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### install required dependencies
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### run the app
```bash 
python src/train.py
